  <p>The most difficult challenge I had with this assignment was probably setting up atom. I was confused when
  I was unable to access the repository through atom. I believe this was because of me needing special permissions
  from the instructor to be able to access the private repository. I ended up just using MobaXterm because I knew
  how to access a private repository that way. Through atom I kept getting an error, "github could not resolve
  to a repository with that name." I'll just figure this out for the next assignment. This was my first time coding
  in HTML, so everything I learned was pretty much brand new to me, although I have looked at the html code on 
  websites in the past. The main resource I used was just my notes and Piazza, although I didn't really have
  any outstanding issues. I would like to learn more about html style guidelines as I didn't really understand
  how to structure my code.</p>

  <p>This assignment seemed pretty daunting at first, but I think I did pretty well considering that this was my first
  time writing in CSS. My process was pretty much trial-and-error. As I shifted stuff around and experimented in CSS,
  I would just save and see how my changes affected the page. Honestly, this was a pretty fun assignment getting my page
  as close as I could to the mocks. My biggest difficulties were in the positioning of the header. I had the toughest
  time with getting the search bar to stay on the right when the page was resizing. I overall learned a lot about CSS
  and had a lot of fun doing so. The resource I used the most was the recorded lectures. Reviewing the material helped me
  gain insight on how to layout the website. I also would just simply Google stuff like, "how to make a fixed button on a 
  webpage" to find the exact syntax for fixed buttons. I also Googled resources on flex boxes to familiarize myself more 
  with them. </p>
