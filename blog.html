  <p>The most difficult challenge I had with this assignment was probably setting up atom. I was confused when
  I was unable to access the repository through atom. I believe this was because of me needing special permissions
  from the instructor to be able to access the private repository. I ended up just using MobaXterm because I knew
  how to access a private repository that way. Through atom I kept getting an error, "github could not resolve
  to a repository with that name." I'll just figure this out for the next assignment. This was my first time coding
  in HTML, so everything I learned was pretty much brand new to me, although I have looked at the html code on 
  websites in the past. The main resource I used was just my notes and Piazza, although I didn't really have
  any outstanding issues. I would like to learn more about html style guidelines as I didn't really understand
  how to structure my code.</p>
