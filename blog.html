  <h1>Entry 1</h1>
  <h2>Date of entry: 4/8/20</h2>
  <p>The most difficult challenge I had with this assignment was probably setting up atom. I was confused when
  I was unable to access the repository through atom. I believe this was because of me needing special permissions
  from the instructor to be able to access the private repository. I ended up just using MobaXterm because I knew
  how to access a private repository that way. Through atom I kept getting an error, "github could not resolve
  to a repository with that name." I'll just figure this out for the next assignment. This was my first time coding
  in HTML, so everything I learned was pretty much brand new to me, although I have looked at the html code on 
  websites in the past. The main resource I used was just my notes and Piazza, although I didn't really have
  any outstanding issues. I would like to learn more about html style guidelines as I didn't really understand
  how to structure my code.</p>
  
  <h1>Entry 2</h1>
  <h2>Date of entry: 4/27/20</h2>
  <p>This assignment seemed pretty daunting at first, but I think I did pretty well considering that this was my first
  time writing in CSS. My process was pretty much trial-and-error. As I shifted stuff around and experimented in CSS,
  I would just save and see how my changes affected the page. Honestly, this was a pretty fun assignment getting my page
  as close as I could to the mocks. My biggest difficulties were in the positioning of the header. I had the toughest
  time with getting the search bar to stay on the right when the page was resizing. I overall learned a lot about CSS
  and had a lot of fun doing so. The resource I used the most was the recorded lectures. Reviewing the material helped me
  gain insight on how to layout the website. I also would just simply Google stuff like, "how to make a fixed button on a 
  webpage" to find the exact syntax for fixed buttons. I also Googled resources on flex boxes to familiarize myself more 
  with them. </p>
  
  <h1>Entry 3</h1>
  <h2>Date of entry: 5/11/2020</h2>
  <p>This assignment was easier than the CSS assignment in my opinion. I didn't really struggle through any one specific part
  of the assignment as I found JavaScript to be pretty intuitive. For any part I had a question on, I once again referred
  to the recorded lectures or Google. I am honestly finding that one of the perks of quarantine is the recorded lectures. If
  I ever roughly recall something, but don't know it exactly, it's nice that I can go to the exact lecture and find the original
  explanation. One thing I did have to Google was how to make the search on the Twits to be case insensitive. The method I used
  was using the .toLowerCase() function on both the text content and the user-inputted search text. One thing I also learned was
  appending in order. When I appended the author's name before I appended the twit text it made the twit look all wonky. The simple
  solution was just to append the twit text before appending the author's name. Overall, this assignment went very well for me. </p>
